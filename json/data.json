        "This is my first SaaS-based project/product and frankly speaking, this was just started as a fun project like I was wanted to create something like linktr.ee from the very first day I started web development and later on I discussed the idea with a very good friend of mine who is also a web/mobile developer and he is very good at back-end so I thought this is the right time to build this project and it took us a month to complete this project. Biotree is built using Nuxt.js(Vue.js framework) for the front-end and if we talk about the back-end stacks so it was Python Django for the rest API and PostgreSQL for the database and to be honest this project taught me a lot of things in the development and project management.",
        "I marketed it over Instagram through my Instagram profile only and we managed to get our first 100+ users in the first week of its launch. If we talk about the current stats of the SAAS based product so we have 200+ users and 2-3K monthly hits and it's doing pretty well so we will release new versions of it with new features.",
        "Creating a Biotree takes seconds. Add links and profile pictures and it is done.",
