      Iâ€™m probably the most passionate designer you will ever work with. I've
      been designing ever since I was in school, though I came to it from a
      different career path of finance.
    </p>
    <p class="wow slideInUp">
      I've shown my love for design in many ways. I was the head of the design
      team in college. I started teaching design on my YouTube channel. I
      decided to take it to the next level and help and mentor design
      enthusiasts who are keen on getting into the design industry.
